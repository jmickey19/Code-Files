                <p>My parents live in a more rural neighborhood in my hometown. I was late to school one day because a giant boar was blocking the road. It was massive and could have seriously damaged my car.    We typically get snakes, bunnies, raccoons, etc. in the neighborhood but no one had seen a boar before. So naturally my teacher didn't believe me and neither did my parents. I didn't get in trouble but I was definitely made fun of as if I claimed I saw Big Foot or something.  Then my dad was late because of the boar. My mom and other family thought we were joking around and still didn't believe us. Finally a year later my mom saw the stupid boar. To her credit, she called and apologized.</p>
