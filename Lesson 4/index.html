                    <p>In a clip from the National Geographic programme Cannibal Sharks, which will form part of their Sharkfest series this summer, it is revealed that shark cannibalism begins in the womb.<br> Female sand tiger sharks have two wombs and often conceives six or seven embryos in each womb at once, often sired by different fathers, but they only give birth to two shark pups.<br> While scientists were previously baffled, new technology has revealed that as soon as the oldest embryo develops eyes and teeth,<h3>it hunts and kills its siblings in the womb.</h3></p>
