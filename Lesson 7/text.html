        <h1>Text Styling</h1>
        <p>I guessed "Megalomaniacal" straight up playing hangman once; no letters on the board. Everyone was convinced I'd watched the person look it up in the dictionary.</p>
        
        <h2>A Blockquote</h2>
        <blockquote>In my junior year of high school, this guy asked me on a date. He rented a Redbox movie and made a pizza. We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He looked me dead in the eye and said, "This is the worst part." I then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza out with his bare hands, rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs. We never had a second date.</blockquote>
